## Consumer Simulation
[Website link](https://engineerfaunce.github.io/consumer-simulation/)

This was a project I worked on back in high school for my economics class. Students were free to choose their project format, so I decided to build a website that used the Bootstrap framework.

I didn't know a whole lot about web development then and I still don't know much now, but I'm slowly learning more and more so that one day I can build an online portfolio. For now though I hope you enjoy looking at one of my past projects!
